	<p>
		A demo and stress test of the worker pool:
		<ul>
			<li>The output should count monotonically from 0 to 100.</li>
			<li>The difference between the last input and last output should reach an upper bound smaller than 100.</li>
			<li>The number of idle workers should remain at or near 0 until the end.</li>
			<li>At the end, the number of idle workers should increase to the pool size.</li>
		</ul>
		This indicates that the pool controls the input flow, the outputs are
		delivered in order, the pool is fully utilized and no workers are leaked.
