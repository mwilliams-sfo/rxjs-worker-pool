	<p>
		A demo and stress test of the worker pool:
		<ul>
			<li>The result should count monotonically from 0 to 100.</li>
			<li>The number of idle workers should remain at or near 0 until the end.</li>
			<li>At the end, the number of idle workers should increase to the pool size.</li>
		</ul>
		This indicates that the pool is fully utilized, the results are delivered in
		order, and no workers are leaked.
